## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

This project was fairly easy to code the javascript section.
The css and html for how the page changes structure was rather fun to figure out. The hero image changes position based on the view, so it required a little research.

Overall, this project helped me refresh my string manipulation knowledge. I had to check for several scenarios, such as
- Does the input contain an '@' character?
- Does the input value contain a domain name?
- Does the input value contain a subdomain after the '@' character?
- Does the input value contain a TLD (Top Level Domain) after the  '.' character?


### Continued development

There is definitely room for improvement. One of my goals is to create this in Nextjs.
